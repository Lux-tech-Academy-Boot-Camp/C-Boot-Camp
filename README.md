C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop operating systems, browsers, games, and so on. 

C++ supports different ways of programming like procedural, object-oriented, functional, and so on. This makes C++ powerful as well as flexible.

Our C++ programming tutorial will guide you to learn C++ programming one step at a time. 



### **About C++ Programming.**

**Multi-paradigm Language** - C++ supports at least seven different styles of programming. Developers can choose any of the styles.

**General Purpose Language** - You can use C++ to develop games, desktop apps, operating systems, and so on.

**Speed** - Like C programming, the performance of optimized C++ code is exceptional.

**Object-oriented** - C++ allows you to divide complex problems into smaller sets by using objects.

### **Why Learn C++?**
C++ is used to develop games, desktop apps, operating systems, browsers, and so on because of its performance.

After learning C++, it will be much easier to learn other programming languages like Java, Python, etc.

C++ helps you to understand the internal architecture of a computer, how computer stores and retrieves information.
